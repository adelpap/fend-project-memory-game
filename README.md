# Memory game
Hello! This is my memory game project for [FEND](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).
It's a  memory game run on the browser where the player has to flip cards in order to find all the matching ones.

## How to play the game
The game can be played on a browser.

The player can see a deck of 16 cards facing down and has to find the matching cards by clicking on the cards and flipping them.

Only two cards can be flipped each time. There is a timer that starts counting when the user first clicks on a card and a moves counter. There is also a star score that goes down every 16 moves the player makes and a reset button that can restart the game.

At the end of the game a screen pops up showing the final score in stars, the amount of moves the player made and the time that has passed. It also includes a restart button that lets the player restart the game.

## Usage
The project consists of these files:

`app.js` - A javascript file that contains all the interactive code of the game

`app.css` - A styles file that contains all the game's styles

`index.html` - An index file that contains the html of the game
